<h2>Music is love!</h2>
<p>I have completed two levels of Hindustani Classical Music exams in vocal training, conducted by Prayag Sangeet Samiti. My training has deepened my appreciation for classical music, while I also enjoy exploring Bollywood songs. This blend of classical and contemporary music influences my musical journey, reflecting my diverse interests and dedication to the art form.</p>
